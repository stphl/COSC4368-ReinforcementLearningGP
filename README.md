Our system dependencies include: numpy as np, random, and matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Before running our project, please make sure to have these dependecies installed and loaded.

To run our project, please run each individual code chunk starting from the top down.
- The very first chunk imports our system dependecies mentioned above.
- The next couple intializes our Q table and Agent class with their subsequent methods and functions.
- The last four code chunk cells contains the 4 experiments we were required to implement.
